<h3>Potato Whole Genome Sequence Data Access</h3>
<p>We are making the draft genome sequence of Solanum tuberosum RH and Solanum phureja DM1-3 516R44 (CIP801092) available to community prior to publication with the expectation that the community will not encroach on our efforts to analyze and publish a whole genome analysis of potato. Thus, by accepting the terms of this agreement and accessing the associated draft genome sequence data, you are agreeing not to publish whole-genome or whole chromosome scale analyses of the potato genome, analyses of gene families/genome structures/repetitive sequences, comparative analyses with other organisms including other plant genomes, or other analyses such that they encroach and limit our opportunity to publish the findings of our work.</p>
<p>We are making the potato genome sequence available through an early release. The genome assemblies have not been thoroughly examined or reviewed and thus may contain errors and should be considered preliminary. Thus, the user should verify or validate any sequence that they suspect may be in error.</p>
<p>The data may be downloaded and used by those who agree to these terms of release. It should not be further re-distributed or publicly released. Thus, if you wish for someone in your laboratory to use the data, they must all read and agree to the access terms as defined on this web page.</p>
<p>If the data are used in a publication, it should be cited as "Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium."</p>
